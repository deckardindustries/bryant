> **Bryant** is a modified Creality Ender 5 3D Printer

The goal of the project is to take the very affordable Creality Ender 5 (Pro/Plus) and to make it a very solid [CoreXY](https://corexy.com/theory.html) printer. You might even go as far as to say it will get in the range of something like a [Voron](https://vorondesign.com) or [RatRig](https://www.ratrig.com). Will it replace them, no. But if you don't want to build your own printer from scratch, like to mod a printer you already got, have most of the parts available from other builds or got an Ender 5 for an affordable price these modifications will get you in the ballpark of those printers.

## Features

* Improve the motion system to 'true' CoreXY and linear rails using the [Mercury One.1 System](https://zerog.one/index.html)
* Improve the extruder and part cooling by using the [EVA system](https://main.eva-3d.page)
* Improve the frame rigidity by adding extra aluminium brackets and plates
* Improve the software by running [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org) ([Mainsail](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail)) which uses input shaping and pressure advance

## Inspiration

80% of the parts in this project are based on other projects for the Ender 5. We will use parts from the Mercury One project, the Eva 3D project. Other parts and ideas are inspired by the Voron community, the RatRig V Core printer and the VZBot printer. A huge thanks to all of the people behind those project for open-sourcing their parts so we can use and build upon them!
