# Introduction

The goal of the project is to take the very affordable Ender 5 (Pro/Plus) and to make it a very solid CoreXY printer. You might even go as far as to say it will get in the range of something like a Voron or RatRig. Will it replace them no. But if you don't want to build your own printer from scratch, like to mod a printer you already got or got an Ender for an affordable price this will get you in the ballpark.

## Features

* Improve the motion system with 'true' CoreXY and linear rails
* Improve the carriage and extruder by using the Eva system
* Improve the software by running Klipper which uses input shaping and pressure advance

## Inspiration

80% of the parts in this project are based on other projects for the Ender 5. We will use parts from the Mercury One project, the Eva 3D project. Other parts and ideas are inspired by the Voron community, the RatRig V Core printer and the VZBot printer. A huge thanks to all of the people behind those project for open-sourcing their parts so we can use and build upon them!





## Costs

The stock parts of the printer will be used as much as possible. Considering the print quality and improvements we are getting I would say that this is quite an affordable mod if you compare it with building your own printer from scratch. The cost of the printer itself is around 250 euros (even cheaper if you buy secondhand or get a good deal). 

If you spend around the same amount on upgrade parts it will bring the total cost of the printer to around 500 euros and you have a very good capable machine for that price. As with anything 3D printing you can always spend more and get even better quality components. This mod doesn't scim on parts, we'll get genuine parts wherever possible but we'll also try to keep it cost-effective. The cost of tools aren't included but most of these mods can probably be done with tools you already have. You might need some crimping wires for some cables or buy an MicroSD card if you don't already have one. Those are not included in the BOM.
