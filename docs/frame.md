# Frame

## Dissasemble

If you haven't already, dissasemble the X and Y motion system. That means removing the gantry and the linear rod on the back. All that should be left are the extrusions on the frame. All those parts can be stored in a box, we won't need any of these parts.

If you are re-using the hotend, remove it from the gantry plate by removing the cover and unscrewing the hotend. Set it aside for using it in the EVA system later.

## Corner Brackets

### Hardware

| Part                        | Amount   | 
| ----------------------------| -------- | 
| 2020 Corner Brackets        | `16x`    | 
| M5 T-nut                    | `32x`    |
| M5x8mm BHCS                 | `32x`    |

### Assembly

Take the 2020 Corner Brackets, T-nuts and bolts and place 2 of them in each corner on the bottom and the top. Each corner of the frame will now have a 2 corner bracket enforcing the extrusions. _Loosely tighten all the bolts._

## L-Shapes Plate

Take the L-Shapes plates, T-nuts and bolts and place 4 of them on the front and 4 of them on the back of the frame. _Loosely tighten all the bolts._

| Part                        | Amount   | 
| ----------------------------| -------- | 
| 2020 L-Shaped Plates        | `8x`    | 
| M5 T-nut                    | `40x`    |
| M5x8mm BHCS                 | `40x`    |



## Square up
Starting with a sqaured up frame is a critical step. [Nero3DP has an excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSg7RDLgYV0) on how to assemble your extrusions as square as possible. _After you've put every part in place fully tighten all the bolts_. When you're finished check each corner with a t-square to make sure it is as square as possible. A frame that is not square will show print artifacts and will more quickly wear out the parts on the motion system.
