# Print Settings

The other sections for each part of the build will list the parts that are used. Here are some recommended materials and slicer settings to print those with. You can print these parts on the Ender 5 but you will need to enclose it to print with the higher-temperature filaments. Or use another printer that is already enclosed.

## Filament

ABS(+) is likely the material you'll want to print these parts with. If you'll want to enlcosure this printer in the future PLA and PETG will warp with higher temperatures. We'll also be printing parts (EVA) that are close to the hotend. ABS(+) is more temperature resistant.

There are better and stronger materials out there like Nylon. If you have some lying around some parts (like frame braces) can be printed with that material to offer some more rigidity. But in general, ABS(+) is an affordable filament type and cost-effective.


## Printing Instructions

| Setting     | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Layer Height`       | 0.20mm (optimal) or 0.24mm (draft for larger parts)  |
| `Perimeters`       | 4 |
| `Top/Bottom layers`       | 5 |
| `Infill`    | 25% (or higher) |
| `Supports`    | None |
| `Brim`    | Optional* (if necessary) |

## Part orientation

Not all parts will have the optimal orientation when loaded into your slicer. Usually you'll want to have the part lay flat on the build plate with the largest flat side on the bottom for optimal part strength.
