You might even go as far as to say it will get in the range of something like a Voron or RatRig . Will it replace them, no. But if you don't want to build your own printer from scratch, like to mod a printer you already got, have most of the parts available from other builds or got an Ender 5 for an affordable price these modifications will get you in the ballpark of those printers. Features Improve the motion system to 'true' CoreXY and linear rails using the Mercury One.1 System Improve the extruder and part cooling by using the EVA system Improve the frame rigidity by adding extra aluminium brackets and plates Improve the software by running Klipper ( Mainsail ) which uses input shaping and pressure advance Inspiration 80% of the parts in this project are based on other projects for the Ender 5. We will use parts from the Mercury One project, the Eva 3D project. Other parts and ideas are inspired by the Voron community, the RatRig V Core printer and the VZBot printer. A huge thanks to all of the people behind those project for open-sourcing their parts so we can use and build upon them! Showcase Coming Soon; video's of it printing, gallery of parts that are printed on the machine Specifications Keywords for this build are High-Speed , Moderately sized and Accurate Parts . If would mod (build) the Printer completely following the current BOM you'll get the following specifications: 235x235 bed size (same as the original) Speeds of 60mm/s with 300mm/s^2 without sacrificing print quality To give you some more numbers: Calibration Cube was printed in 10 minutes instead of 20 minutes with the stock machine A Bench was printed in 20 minutes instead of 45 minutes with the stock machine Costs The stock parts of the printer will be used as much as possible. Considering the print quality and improvements we are getting I would say that this is quite an affordable mod if you compare it with building your own printer from scratch. The cost of the printer itself is around 250 euros (even cheaper if you buy secondhand, get a good deal or bought a 'returned' printer from a reseller). It depends on how you source parts. It can be more depending on what kind of things you decide to order for your specific build. As with anything 3D printing you can always spend more and get even better quality components. This mod doesn't scim on parts, we'll get genuine parts wherever possible but we'll also try to keep it cost-effective. With all that being said it will cost you around ~\u20ac300 in parts (tools aren't included) which brings the total cost of this printer to around \u20ac550. Relatively affordable compared to similar self-build CoreXY printers.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"The goal of the project is to take the very affordable Creality Ender 5 (Pro/Plus) and to make it a very solid CoreXY printer.
